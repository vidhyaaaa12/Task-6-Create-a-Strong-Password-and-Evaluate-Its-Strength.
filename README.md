# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.

## Task Overview
**Objective:** Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its strength using online tools.

## Tools Used
- [Password Monster](https://passwordmonster.com/) – Password strength checker

##  Steps Completed

### 1. Created Passwords
- Generated multiple passwords with varying complexity:
  - `GoSecure!1` (Weak)
  - `BlueSky_12` (Medium)
  - `q#XgP9@!eRt5&Ls3Zw` (Very Strong)
  - `MyC@tH@tesR@ts123` (Very Strong)

### 2. Tested Password Strength
Used Password Monster to analyze the strength of each password. Scores ranged from **Very Weak** to **Very Strong**, depending on complexity and length.

### 3. Noted Scores & Feedback
- Weak passwords got flagged for being too short or using common words.
- Stronger ones were praised for mixed characters and unpredictability.

### 4. Best Practices Identified
- Use 12+ characters.
- Mix upper & lowercase letters.
- Include numbers and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and personal info.
- Use different passwords for different accounts.

### 5. Tips Learned
- Adding length improves strength more than just adding symbols.
- Avoid repeating characters or using predictable patterns.
- Random passphrases can be both secure and memorable.

### 6. Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force:** Tries all combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common words or phrases.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Tests leaked username-password pairs.

### 7. Password Complexity & Security
- Complex passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- Multi-factor authentication enhances protection.
- Password managers can help generate and store strong passwords.

## 8. How Password Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity is one of the most critical elements in securing digital accounts. A complex password is harder to guess, crack, or brute-force, which greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

A strong, complex password typically includes:
-  Uppercase and lowercase letters
-  Numbers (0–9)
-  Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)
-  Minimum of 12 characters
-  No dictionary words or personal information


|  Factor                | Security Impact                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Length**             | Longer passwords take exponentially more time to brute-force       |
| **Character Variety**  | Increases the number of possible combinations                      |
| **Unpredictability**   | Prevents pattern-based or dictionary attacks                       |
| **No Personal Info**   | Avoids social engineering or educated guesses                      |

###  Key Takeaways

- More complexity = more time to crack
- Always use a mix of character types
- Avoid real words, patterns, and personal data
- Consider passphrases: easy to remember but hard to crack (e.g., `Green!Cloud-Jumps2025`)
- Combine with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for maximum protection
